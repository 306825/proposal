This is lengthy and time taking process which depends on the person's skill and not having a standard accuracy. The automated Leukaemia detection system analyses the microscopic image and overcomes these drawbacks. It extracts the required parts of the images and applies some filtering techniques. K-mean clustering approach is used for white blood cells detection. The histogram equalization and Zack algorithm is applied for grouping white blood cells. Some of the features like mean, standard deviation, colour, area, perimeter, etc. are calculated for leukaemia detection. The SVM is used for classification. The proposed system is tested on image dataset and 93.57% accuracy is achieved. The proposed system is successfully implemented in MATLAB."

abstract = "With the growing amount of high resolution microscopy images automatic nano-particle detection, shape analysis and size determination have gained importance for providing quantitative support that gives important information for the evaluation of the material. In this paper, we present a new method for detection of nano-particles and determination of their shapes and sizes simultaneously with deep learning. The proposed method employs multiple output convolutional neural networks (MO-CNN) and has two outputs: first is the detection output that gives the locations of the particles and the other one is the segmentation output for providing the boundaries of the nano-particles. The final sizes of particles are determined with the modified Hough algorithm that runs on the segmentation output. The proposed method is tested and evaluated on a dataset containing 17 TEM images of Fe3O4 and silica coated nano-particles. Also, we compared these results with U-net algorithm which is a popular deep learning method. The experiments showed that the proposed method has 98.23% accuracy for detection and 96.59% accuracy for segmentation of nano-particles."
